[Autotools]
To generate the required files to build the project, run:

    % aclocal
    % autoconf
    % autoheader
    % automake

From there, see the INSTALL file for instructions.

[Glib]
Pedant is highly reliant on Glib, and uses the latter's types for all basic C
types.

[Logging]
Glib provides a messaging architecture that Pedant uses for all its logging.
Logs are sent to stdout or stderr at the verbosity level requested by the
configuration, but are also recorded in the database at maximum verbosity. This
permits replaying the logs of previous sessions at higher verbosity to help
diagnose issues.

Two functions are available for literal and printf-style logging:

    logl(level, message)
    logf(level, format, ...)

There are several levels of logging available, defined as follows:

1. MESSAGE: Messages to the user.
2. ERROR: Unrecoverable coding errors, resulting in an immediate core dump.
3. CRITICAL: Unrecoverable non-coding errors.
4. WARN: Recoverable non-coding errors.
5. INFO: Detailed information about current events.
6. DEBUG: Insanely detailed, step-by-step rundown of all events.
